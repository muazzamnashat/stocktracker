      <p>Analysts research public financial statements, listen in on conference calls and talk to managers and the customers of a company. Ultimately, through all this investigation into the company's performance, the analyst decides whether the stock is a "buy," sell," or hold. These pie charts show the distribution of recommendations on your stocks!"</p>
